I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/) of [Secure Learning Lab](https://aisecure.github.io/GROUP/index.html). My research focuses on the trustworthiness of foundation models and agents.

Before that, I received my B.S. in Information Security at Fudan University. My undergraduate advisors are Prof. [Sheng Li](https://blazelisheng.github.io/) and Prof. [Yuan Zhang](https://yuanxzhang.github.io/).

Besides research, I enjoy playing tennis🎾, guitar🎸 and piano🎹. My favourite tennis player is Roger Federer.
