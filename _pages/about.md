I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/) of [Secure Learning Lab](https://aisecure.github.io/GROUP/index.html). My research interests lie in robustness, privacy, and natural language processing.

Before that, I received my B.S. in Information Security at Fudan University. My undergraduate advisors are Prof. [Sheng Li](https://blazelisheng.github.io/) and Prof. [Yuan Zhang](https://yuanxzhang.github.io/).

Besides research, I like playing tennis🎾 and piano🎹. My favourite tennis player is Roger Federer!😍
