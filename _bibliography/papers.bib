  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={SecretGen: Privacy Recovery on Pre-trained Models via Distribution Discrimination},
  author={Yuan, Zhuowen and Wu, Fan and Long, Yunhui and Xiao, Chaowei and Li, Bo},
  abstract={Transfer learning through the use of pre-trained models has become a growing trend for the machine learning community. Consequently, numerous pre-trained models are released online to facilitate further research. However, it raises extensive concerns on whether these pre-trained models would leak privacy-sensitive information of their training data. Thus, in this work, we aim to answer the following questions: "Can we effectively recover private information from these pre-trained models? What are the sufficient conditions to retrieve such sensitive information?" We first explore different statistical information which can discriminate the private training distribution from other distributions. Based on our observations, we propose a novel private data reconstruction framework, SecretGen, to effectively recover private information. Compared with previous methods which can recover private data with the ground true prediction of the targeted recovery instance, SecretGen does not require such prior knowledge, making it more practical. We conduct extensive experiments on different datasets under diverse scenarios to compare SecretGen with other baselines and provide a systematic benchmark to better understand the impact of different auxiliary information and optimization operations. We show that without prior knowledge about true class prediction, SecretGen is able to recover private data with similar performance compared with the ones that leverage such prior knowledge. If the prior knowledge is given, SecretGen will significantly outperform baseline methods. We also propose several quantitative metrics to further quantify the privacy vulnerability of pre-trained models, which will help the model selection for privacy-sensitive applications.

  title={On Generating Identifiable Virtual Faces},
  author={Yuan, Zhuowen and You, Zhengxin and Li, Sheng and Zhang, Xinpeng and Qian, Zhenxin and Alex C. Kot},
  abstract={Face anonymization with generative models have become increasingly prevalent since they sanitize private information by generating virtual face images, ensuring both privacy and image utility. Such virtual face images are usually not identifiable after the removal or protection of the original identity. In this paper, we formalize and tackle the problem of generating identifiable virtual face images. Our virtual face images are visually different from the original ones for privacy protection. In addition, they are bound with new virtual identities, which can be directly used for face recognition. We propose an Identifiable Virtual Face Generator (IVFG) to generate the virtual face images. The IVFG projects the latent vectors of the original face images into virtual ones according to a user specific key, based on which the virtual face images are generated. To make the virtual face images identifiable, we propose a multi-task learning objective as well as a triplet styled training strategy to learn the IVFG. We evaluate the performance of our virtual face images using different face recognizers on diffident face image datasets, all of which demonstrate the effectiveness of the IVFG for generate identifiable virtual face images.},
